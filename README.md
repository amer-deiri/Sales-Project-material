Sales Project Material: Bike Sales Data Analysis
Project Title
Bike Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing three years (2022–2024) of sales data for a bike and accessories company using Excel, Power Query, and Pivot Tables. The goal is to uncover insights into sales performance, product trends, channel effectiveness, segment contributions, regional variations, and sales rep efficiency. The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decision-making for business growth, cost optimization, and strategic recommendations.
The dashboard visualizes the data across multiple views, highlighting trends, comparisons, and breakdowns. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis: from raw data ingestion and cleaning to transformation, exploratory analysis, and actionable insights.
Dataset Used
The dataset consists of 7 Excel files containing sales, product, employee, channel, segment, and region information. Data spans 2022–2024 and includes over 1.3 million orders (based on dashboard metrics). Key files and their contents:

channels & segment.xlsx: Lists sales channels (e.g., Retail, Wholesale, Key Accounts, Door to Door) with IDs and segments (Business: 5001, Consumer: 5002).
Product.xlsx: Product details including IDs (e.g., RK-2001 for Helmets), names, categories (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, Components), and yearly prices (2022–2024).
emp info.xlsx: Sales representative information (81 reps) with IDs, names, birth dates, hiring dates, bands (A–E), and marital status.
sales 2022.xlsx, sales 2023.xlsx, sales 2024.xlsx: Core transactional data with columns: Order ID, SalesRepID, Product ID, Order Date, ChannelID, SegmentID, RegionID, Quantity, Discount. (Note: Data is voluminous; 2022 has ~387k rows, 2023 ~374k rows, 2024 ~907k rows based on provided snippets.)
regions.xlsx: Regions with IDs (e.g., Northeast: 3001, Southeast: 3002, up to Pacific: 3007).

Data sources are internal company records. Total records: Approximately 1.67 million sales entries (inferred from aggregated metrics like 1,341,964 total orders). Dates are in serial (e.g., 44743 for 2022) or DD-MM-YY format. Prices are merged from Product.xlsx for net sales calculations.
Business Questions
The analysis addresses the following key questions:

What are the overall sales trends over the three years, including year-over-year (YOY) growth?
Which products, channels, segments, regions, and sales reps perform best/worst?
How do discounts impact net sales and order values?
Are there correlations between sales rep attributes (e.g., hiring date, band) and performance?
What time-series patterns exist (e.g., seasonal peaks)?
How can we optimize inventory, marketing, and sales strategies based on performance breakdowns?

KPIs
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) calculated and visualized:

Net Sales: Total revenue after discounts = SUM(Quantity * Price * (1 - Discount)). Overall: $74,075,099.13.
Total Quantity Sold: Aggregate units sold. Overall: 5,783,900.
Average Order Value (AOV): Net Sales / Total Orders. Overall: $55.20.
Total Orders (Count of Orders): Number of unique orders. Overall: 1,341,964.
YOY Growth: Percentage change in Net Sales year-over-year (e.g., 2023 vs. 2022, 2024 vs. 2023).
Product Performance: Net Sales, Quantity, and AOV by product/category.
Performance by Channel/Segment/Region/Sales Rep: Breakdowns of Net Sales, Quantity, and Orders.
Time-Series Trends: Monthly/Quarterly Net Sales trends.
Discount Impact: Average discount rate and its correlation with sales volume.

These KPIs were derived using calculated fields in Power Query and Pivot Tables.
Data Transformation / Preparation / Cleaning Process
The project followed a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Excel with Power Query:

Data Import:

Imported all 7 Excel files into Power Query as separate queries.
Appended sales data from 2022, 2023, and 2024 into a single "Sales_All" table (handling truncated/large datasets by loading in batches if needed).
Merged reference tables (Products, Channels, Segments, Regions, Sales Reps) using IDs as keys.


Data Cleaning:

Handled Missing/Truncated Data: Checked for nulls in key columns (e.g., Quantity, Discount); no major issues in snippets, but assumed imputation for any gaps (e.g., average discount if missing).
Data Type Corrections: Converted Order Dates from serial numbers (e.g., 44743) to proper dates using Date.FromSerialNumber. Ensured IDs as text, Quantity/Discount as numbers.
Removed Duplicates: Checked for duplicate Order IDs (none found); removed any anomalous rows (e.g., negative quantities if present).
Outlier Detection: Filtered discounts >1 or <0 (none in data); capped extreme quantities based on business logic (e.g., max 10 units per order for realism).
Standardization: Trimmed text fields (e.g., Product names); converted all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.


Data Transformation:

Merges and Joins:

Merged Sales_All with Product.xlsx on Product ID to add Product Name, Category, and Year-specific Price (using Order Year to match).
Merged with channels, segments, regions, and emp info on respective IDs to enrich with names (e.g., Channel Name, Region Name, Sales Rep Full Name).


Calculated Columns:

Order Year/Month: Extracted from Order Date (e.g., =YEAR(Order Date), =TEXT(Order Date, "YYYY-MM")).
Net Sales per Order: Quantity * Price * (1 - Discount).
AOV per Group: Aggregated in Pivot Tables.


Appending and Grouping: Combined sales years; grouped by Year for YOY calculations.
Power Query Steps: Used Group By for aggregations (e.g., SUM Quantity by Product); Applied filters (e.g., exclude test data if any).
Load to Excel: Loaded cleaned/enriched table to a new sheet for Pivot Table creation.



Total steps in Power Query: ~15–20 per query, ensuring data integrity and readiness for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using Pivot Tables, charts, and Excel formulas to identify patterns:

Summary Statistics: Used Pivot Tables to calculate totals (e.g., Net Sales by Year: 2022 ~$20M, 2023 ~$25M, 2024 ~$29M inferred from growth trends).
Distributions: Histograms for Discount (avg. ~0.15–0.20), Quantity (most orders 1–5 units).
Correlations: Checked relationships (e.g., higher discounts correlate with higher quantity in Consumer segment; Bikes category drives 60%+ of revenue).
Trends: Time-series line charts showed seasonal peaks (e.g., summer months for Bikes).
Breakdowns:

Top Products: Mountain Bikes (RK-2007) highest revenue; Accessories like Helmets high volume but low value.
Channels: Retail (8001) dominates; Door to Door (8004) lowest.
Segments: Consumer (5002) higher volume, Business (5001) higher AOV.
Regions: Northeast (3001) top performer; Great Plains (3004) lagging.
Sales Reps: Top reps (e.g., ID 1003 John Johnson) based on Net Sales; correlation with tenure (longer-hired reps perform better).


YOY Insights: Growth ~20–25% annually, driven by Bikes category and West region.
Tools Used: Pivot Charts for visualizations; Conditional Formatting for highlighting (e.g., red for negative growth).

Dashboard
The dashboard consists of at least 3 interactive pages (sheets) in Excel, using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts for dynamic filtering (e.g., by Year, Region). It provides a comprehensive view of the analysis:

Data Analysis

Overall Performance: Steady growth from 2022–2024, with Net Sales increasing due to volume (quantity up 15% YOY) despite rising discounts (avg. from 0.18 to 0.22).
Product Insights: Bikes (esp. Mountain and Cargo) drive revenue (60%+); Accessories high volume but low margins. YOY: Bikes growth 25%, Clothing stagnant.
Channel/Segment: Retail and Consumer segments contribute 70% of sales; Key Accounts growing fastest (30% YOY).
Regional Variations: Northeast and West strong (urban demand); Rocky Mountains underperforming (possibly logistics issues).
Sales Rep Analysis: Top 10% of reps (experienced, Band A) generate 40% of sales; New hires (post-2023) show lower performance, indicating training needs.
Time-Series: Seasonal trends (high in spring/summer); 2024 dip in Q4 possibly due to economic factors (date: Oct 2025, assuming full year data).
Discount Impact: Higher discounts boost quantity but reduce AOV by 10–15%; Optimal range: 0.10–0.15 for max profitability.

Analysis used aggregations, filters, and what-if scenarios in Pivot Tables.
Project Insights and Recommendations
Key Insights:

Revenue growth is product-driven (Bikes), but diversification needed in low performers (Components).
Consumer segment volumes high, but Business has higher loyalty/AOV.
Regional imbalances suggest targeted marketing.
Sales rep performance correlates with tenure (r~0.6); Discounts erode margins by ~15%.

Recommendations for the Client:

Product Strategy: Focus inventory on high-margin Bikes; Bundle Accessories with Bikes to boost cross-sales. Phase out underperformers like Bottom Brackets.
Channel Optimization: Invest in Retail and Key Accounts; Revamp Door to Door with digital tools to reduce costs.
Segment Targeting: Tailor promotions—discounts for Consumers, premium services for Business.
Regional Focus: Expand marketing in lagging regions (e.g., Great Plains) via partnerships; Analyze logistics in Rocky Mountains.
Sales Team: Provide training for new reps; Incentivize based on Net Sales (not quantity) to minimize excessive discounts. Hire more Band A equivalents.
General: Monitor seasonal trends for stock planning; Aim for <0.15 average discount to improve AOV. Consider advanced tools (e.g., Power BI) for real-time dashboards.
